<H1 CLASS="western">Overview</H1>
<P>In a <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/memcached.html">previous
article </A>I wrote about an implementation of <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://www.danga.com/memcached">memcached</A>
on JGroups.</P>
<P><A CLASS="western" HREF="http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/replcache.html">ReplCache</A>
is a large virtual hashmap spanning multiple nodes, similar to
memcached. If we have 5 processes (nodes) with 1GB of memory
allocated to each of their hashmap, then we have a virtual hashmap of
5GB. By starting another nodes, the size would increase to 6GB, and
if a node leaves, the size shrinks accordingly.</P>
<P>When we distribute our elements (key and values) to the virtual
hashmap, then – based on <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/archive/2007/11/consistent_hash.html">consistent
hashing</A> – an element gets assigned to a single node, and so we
can use the full 5GB. Reads and writes are always sent to the same
node using the consistent hash of the key. If the node storing
element K crashes, the next read returns null, and the user has to
retrieve K from the database and re-insert it into the virtual
hashmap, this time picking a different node.</P>
<P><I>Distribution</I> therefore always requires some stable storage
(e.g. a DB) from which we can retrieve our elements should a node
hosting an element crash. All writes are of course also written to
the DB in this case. 
</P>
<P>Distribution is similar to <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID_0">RAID
0</A>.</P>
<P>If we don't want to use a database, e.g. because it is a single
point of failure, and access to it is slow, we can just keep our data
in memory. However, to prevent data loss due to a node crash, we have
to replicate all elements.</P>
<P><I>Replication</I> is the opposite of distribution: we have a copy
of a given element K on every node. Should a node crash, clients can
simply pick a different node and K is still present. Updates to K
have to be sent to all nodes. Note that to prevent a catastrophic
failure in which all nodes in the cloud crash, we could still write
updates to the DB, but this could be done in the background.</P>
<P>While replication increases availability and prevents data loss,
we can now effectively only use 1GB out of the 5GB of the above
example: if a node has 1GB of data, and every node replicates its
data to every other node in the 5 node cluster, we'd use up the 5GB
available to us. 
</P>
<P>Replication is similar to <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID_1">RAID
1</A>.</P>
<P>So we can either choose to not replicate anything with potential
data loss but maximal use of the 5GB, or replicate everything to
everyone, which minimizes the risk of data loss but limits us to 1GB
out of the 5GB.</P>
<P><A CLASS="western" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID_5">RAID
5</A> is a solution which doesn't replicate data everywhere (it only
replicates it K times where K &lt; number of disks) and increases the
use of the available size. However, K is fixed and for RAID 5 to
work, we need at least 3 disk.</P>
<P>Enter ReplCache, which allows a developer to define how many times
an element should be available in a cluster. <I>This is defined per
data item with a replication count (K)</I>:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>K == -1: the element is stored on all cluster nodes (full
	replication)</P>
	<LI><P>K == 1: the element stored on a single node only, determined
	through consistent hashing (distribution)</P>
	<LI><P>K &gt; 1: the element is stored K times in the cluster</P>
</UL>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If an element is important, and loss is catastrophic or recreation
costly, then -1 should be chosen. If an element can easily be fetched
from the database again, then 1 might be picked. A value greater than
1 decreases the risk of data loss and saves memory, e.g. if K == 3 (N
== 10), then 3 cluster nodes have to crash at the same time to lose
K. If they don't crash simultaneously, the cluster will rebalance its
data so that K == 3 (unless N &lt; K).</P>
<P>The advantage of defining K per data element is that an
application can define data reliability and thus use more of the
virtual memory allocated<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.</P>

<H1 CLASS="western">Maintaining replicas</H1>
<P>When new nodes are added to the cluster, or removed from the
cluster, ReplCache has to make sure that elements with K == 1 are
still stored on the correct node, based on the consistent hash and
the new cluster topology. 
</P>
<P>Also, with elements that are stored multiple times in the cluster
(K &gt; 1), ReplCache has to make sure that elements are moved or
copied to other nodes. For example, if id=322649 has K == 3 and the
cluster has nodes A and B, 'id' will be stored on A and B. As soon as
C is added, we also have to copy 'id' to C in order to have 3 copies
available. When D is added, we have to figure out whether to store
'id' on D, too. If that's the case, 'id' can be removed on either A,
B or C.</P>
<P>To handle the latter case (K &gt; 1), we compute K hash codes for
the changed cluster topology and pick K nodes (NEW-NODES). Then we
compute K hash codes for the old cluster topology and pick K nodes
(OLD-NODES). If NEW-NODES is the same as OLD-NODES, we don't need to
rebalance a given element. If not, we multicast a PUT, which every
node receives. Every node then checks whether it is in the NEW-NODES
set for the given key and applies the PUT if so, or discards it if
not.</P>

<H1 CLASS="western">Conclusion</H1>
<P>ReplCache is a clustered cache, spanning multiple nodes. 
</P>
<P>Elements can be distributed and optionally replicated to
optimimally store them in the cloud, giving applications control over
space versus reliability tradeoffs by defining replication counts for
individual elements.</P>
<P>We're looking into defining regions of keys, where sets of related
keys are co-located on the same nodes. This would require the
addition of a parameter 'region', which is then used as input to the
consistent hash function (rather than using the key directly). An
example that would benefit from this is HTTP sessions: all attributes
of a given session would be co-located.</P>
